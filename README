This is an RTOS. Do whatever you want with this code if you're reading this.

RTOS for STM f401 board, I think its fun I just made this code to test my C and OS skills

This flashes the code to the STM's flash memory, starting at the isr_vector and according to the linker in linker.ld

To run best, open 3 terminal sessions, and in one run openOCD (./ocd.sh)

In the other, run the makefile which will automatically flash and open GDB

and in the 3rd, run minicom connected to /dev/ttyACM0
